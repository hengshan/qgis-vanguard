    "## Objectives\n",
    "The goal of this three-day course is to provide an overview of applied spatial regression analysis using open source \n",
    "tools ([QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/index.html)) and libraries such as [PYQGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html) and [PYSAL](https://pysal.org/).\n",
    "This course uses Singapore local geospatial data, and we will co-explore spatial analysis using an interactive Python programming tool, [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html). We aim to provide an engaging and hands-on experience on learning, and we believe learning by doing is the best approach. We hope participants can effectively incorporate these tools into their daily work.   "

    "The course will start each day from 9:30am to 12:30pm (morning session) and from 2pm to 5pm (afternoon session). Each session includes lectures (conceptual underpinnings), demonstration (programming), and exercises (hands-on applications). We will attempt to set aside the last half hour or more of each day (i.e., 4:30-5pm) for group discussion of the topics introduced that day.\n",

    "Many topics are introduced in the course lectures (assisted by PowerPoint) that can reasonably be absorbed in three intensive days. \n",
